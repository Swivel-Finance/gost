A basic description and visualization of the Illuminate Protocol's mechanics.
## Introduction
Today, liquidity among fixed rate swap protocols is fragmented. Between the 
various protocols, differing expiries and innefficient pricing, users are 
overwhelmed by the available options. This means that users have to manually
search for the optimal protocol and market to execute their loans which leads to
a poor user experience.

Illuminate aggregates interest rate swap markets within DeFi. In doing so, 
Illuminate provides a one-stop shop for users to get the best fixed rates on
their loans in DeFi.
## Aggregating Interest Rate Swap Protocols
At its core, Illuminate is built to aggregate the interest rate swap market in
DeFi.

Illuminate provides lender the ability to receive the best fixed interest rate
on their loan for a given maturity and underlying asset. The native token of
Illuminate is the zcToken (zero coupon token). One zcToken represents a single
principal token lent out.

In Illuminate's design, zcTokens represent the amount of
principal tokens lent out by the user. After the loan matures, the user can
redeem their zcTokens for the same number of underlying tokens.

## Supported Protocols
Illuminate currently supports the following protocols:
- Swivel
- Pendle
- Tempus
- APWine
- Notion
- Yield
- Sense
- Element
